<p>The process has a service task that is backed by the <code>SendEmailJavaDelegate</code>.</p>

<p>
The <code>SendEmailJavaDelegate</code> defines three fields:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>addressee</li>
    <li>emailSubject</li>
    <li>emailBody</li>
</ul>

<p>
Their values are set in the modeler and then used in the JavaDelegate source code.
</p>
