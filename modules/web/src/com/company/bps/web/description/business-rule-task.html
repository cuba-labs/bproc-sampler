<p>The sample demonstrates how to use business rule tasks in the BPMN process. The decision table evaluates the discount
    by the order amount. To view the decision table use the <b>BProc - Decision Tables</b> screen. There is a <code>order-discount-decision-table</code>
    there.</p>

<h2>How to use the sample</h2>

<p>
    Create the <code>Order</code> entity using the <b>Application - Orders</b> screen. Specify the order amount.
</p>
<p>
    Click the <b>Start process</b> button. Select the order and the approver. After the process is started the business
    rule task will be executed, and the discount value will be put to the <code>discount</code> process variable. You
    may see the value of the discount process variable either on the user task form (the task is assigned to the
    approver) or in the process instance editor (<b>BProc - Process instances</b> screen)
