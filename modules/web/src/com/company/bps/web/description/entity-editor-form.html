<p>
The process demonstrates how to use the screen that is a <code>StandardEditor</code> as a process form.
</p>

<p>
The <code>OrderEditStartForm</code> screen creates a new entity and sets it as an edited entity. When the Start process button is clicked the editor is commited and the process is started. The order is put to process variables.
</p>

<p>
The <code>OrderEditTaskForm</code> sets the order process variable value to the editor. Users can change order entity fields like they do in any entity editor. When any outcome button is clicked, the editor is commited and the task is completed with the corresponding outcome.

<h2>How to use the sample</h2>

<p>
    Click the <b>Start process</b> button. The start process form will appear. Fill fields and start the process. A new order will be saved and a process will be started. After the process is started, you can see the task process form: open the <b>BProc - My Tasks</b> screen, find the task in the list and double-click the task.
