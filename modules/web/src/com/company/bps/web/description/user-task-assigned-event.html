<p>The <code>NotificationsSender</code> bean listens for the <code>UserTaskAssignedEvent</code> spring event of the
    process with the <code>user-task-assigned-event</code> key. When the user task is assigned (the <code>UserTaskAssignedEvent</code>
    is fired) an email is sent.</p>

<h2>How to use the sample</h2>

<p>
    Click the <b>Start process</b> button. In the start process form, select a participant. There must be a user with a
    non-empty email (e.g. <i>alice</i>). After the process is started, an email will be sent. You may find the email
    in the <b>Administration - Email history</b> screen.
