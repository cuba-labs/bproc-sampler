# BProc Samples

The project contains BProc addon usage examples. There are several processes deployed, each demonstrates some BProc addon feature. 

The *Application - Sampler* screen is opened by default after you log in to the application (the credentials are _admin/admin_). The screen allows you to read sample descriptions, view related source codes and start the process.

## How to Include the BProc Trial Version 

Download the BProc trial archive from the [CUBA marketplace](https://www.cuba-platform.com/marketplace/bproc/) and follow the instructions from the *BETA-VERSION* section of the addon description (extract the repository archive to the `repository` directory).
